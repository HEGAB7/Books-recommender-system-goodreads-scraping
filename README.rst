Scraping Data:

We scrape the data from `Goodreads API <https://www.goodreads.com/api/index#review.show>` which gets the books in a member shelf.

Recommender System:

This is a Collaborative filtering Recommender system that we used to build intelligent recommender systems
that can learn to give better recommendations as more information about users is collected.

This recommender take a book name and then recommend to you the most relevant books to it.
